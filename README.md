simple_sentinel
===============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vanchi-zendesk/simple_sentinel.svg?branch=v0.1.1)](https://travis-ci.org/vanchi-zendesk/simple_sentinel)

A simple nodejs utility to start and stop a test sentinel and redis.
Starts redis at port 16379 and sentinel at port 26379.

This is mainly intended as a test helper. If you have several projects which needs to run tests against redis and sentinel, you could include simple_sentinel as a package, and use it to start and stop your redis/sentinel setup.


Configuration
=============

For redis: we start redis with the following config
```
  redis-server
          --daemonize yes
          --logfile <file>
          --dir <dir>
          --loglevel verbose
          --port <port>
```
For sentinel: Created by reading this page: http://redis.io/topics/sentinel
```
  redis-server
          --sentinel
          --daemonize yes
          --logfile <file>
          --pidfile <file>
          --loglevel verbose
          --port <port>
```
with additional configs:
```
  sentinel monitor <master_name> <host> <port> 1
  sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master_name> 2000
  sentinel failover-timeout <master_name> 90000
  sentinel parallel-syncs <master_name> 2
```

Requirements
============

- redis (tested @2.8.4)
- node
- Include this package in your project, run npm install.

Usage
=====

```
-$ node_modules/simple_sentinel/bin/simple_sentinel --help

  Usage: simple_sentinel [start|stop]

  Commands:

    start     start redis and sentinel
    stop      stop redis and sentinel

  Options:

    -h, --help  output usage information
    -f, --config specify a config file
    -r, --redis <ports separated by comma>
    -s, --sentinel <ports separated by comma>
```

Config file
===========
We can specify different ports for redis and sentinels. The first redis port is treated as the master.
```
module.exports = {
  redis : {
    ports: [ 16379, 16380, 16381 ]
  },
  sentinel: {
    ports: [ 26379, 26380, 26381 ]
  }
};
```

In code
=======

You can also use simple_sentinel from code.

```
var simple_sentinel = require('simple_sentinel');
return_code = simple_sentinel.start(config);
return_code = simple_sentinel.stop(config);
```

Notes about stop
================

Stops redis:16379 by sending 'redis-cli -p 16379 shutdown', so watch out if you have redis running on that port.

For the sentinel, since the 'shutdown' command is not working on redis v2.8.4, we try to 'kill -TERM `cat sentinel.pid`'. If the pid file is not found, we further query by doing 'redis-cli -p 26379 | grep process_id', parse the pid and kill it.
